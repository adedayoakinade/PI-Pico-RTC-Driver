# Plentify Python for hardware work product - TASK

The goal of this work product is to evaluate a candidate's ability to implement a basic hardware driver for a chip using Python.

## Goal
Using *only* the [native microPython I2C APIs](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/machine.I2C.html), implement a driver for the  [DS1307](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ds1307.pdf) RTCC.
A basic skeleton API has been provided in the RTC.py file, feel free to update and change this interface as you see fit.

The desired minimum output is a program that reads the current time from the RTC every second, starting from 11:57:23 03/02/2024

## Rules/Guidance
* Create a public git repo on the platform of your choice so others can use your driver in Wokwi, use this repo as a means of demonstrating your understanding of git and source control management
* Use the [Wokwi VSCode plugin](https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/getting-started) to develop and test locally. See [the example project](https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-vscode-micropython)
* Implement this yourself - don't use AI or other online resourses. You will be asked to explain your code later
* Feel free to update the RTC library template to make it more maintainable and extensible
* Write the RTC driver as if it could be shared standalone
* Feel free to edit this README.md file to document your work
* Once complete, share the repo link with your contact at Plentify

### Limitations!
In order to allow the use of an online simulator, programming must be done on a simulated [Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/rp2040.html) using the [microPython](https://micropython.org/) framework.
microPython is a port of Python that is intended to be used on resourse constrained devices like microcontrollers, because of this there are limitations and differences relative to full Python 3. 

Plentify does not use microPython, however for the purposes of this project, it is a good analog

# Plentify Python for hardware work product - SOLUTION

The hardware driver is implememted in the RTC.py file. The RTC class contains the implementations of the following functions:

### get_datetime()
This function fetches the current datetime stored in the RTC and returns as a tupple of integer values in the form (HH, MM, SS, DD, MM, YYYY).

### set_datetime()
This function sets the current datetime in the RTC. The argument is a tuple of the values to be set in the RTC. The structure of the Tuple is  (HH, MM, SS, DD, MM, YYYY). The function returns True if datetime was successfully set, False otherwise.

### initialize_datetime()
This function initializes the datetime in the RTC to a value specified by a Tuple. The structure of the Tuple is (HH, MM, SS, DD, MM, YYYY).

## Other key details

- The I2C address of the RTC is 0x68, as obtaimed from the datasheet.
- The timekeeping register of the RTC has a start address of 00h.
- There are 7 timekeeping registers which are used to store values of Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Day, Date, Month and Year.
- The addresses of these registers are increasing monotonously from the start address of 00h.
- The registers values are in BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)
- Helper functions help to convert the integer vlues to BCD and vice versa for proper storage and display.
